PyDiffusion is a python library to analyze the rotational and translational
diffusion of molecules in molecular dynamics simulation or rigid body simulations.

INSTALL
=======
**Note**: You need cython, numpy and setuptools to install pydiffusion

.. code::
   pip install .

If you want to install the library locally for your user then append the ``--user``
flag.

Usage
=====

Please refer to the `example notebook <https://github.com/bio-phys/pydiffusion/blob/master/example/Analysis.ipynb>`_.

DEVELOPMENT
===========

To install the library in development mode and it's own venv use
